# Another path finding thing

A Quil sketch to display path finding using multiple search algorithms. E.g. BFS, DFS, IDDFS and UCS. 
## Search algorithms used

- Breadth-first search
- Depth-first search
- Iterative deepening depth-first search
- Uniform Cost Search

## Usage

LightTable - open `core.clj` and press `Ctrl+Shift+Enter` to evaluate the file.

Emacs - run cider, open `core.clj` and press `C-c C-k` to evaluate the file.

REPL - run `(require 'path-finding.core)`.

Something else - use your trusted neighborhood search engine or mess around with it until it works!
